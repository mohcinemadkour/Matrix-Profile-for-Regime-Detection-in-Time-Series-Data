Regime Detection in Energy Data using Matrix Profile

# Data set and problem description

In this example we show energy consumption data from a pharmaceutical equipment over the course of a typical 24-hour day. Power consumption is measured in watts. The behavior of the device being measured is fairly typical: during episodes of active usage, power consumption quickly increases from an “idle” or background level of consumption, and then returns to idle power draw after usage ceases. Power consumption is noisy and variable in general. It is also fairly common for the “background” consumption of equipment to be variable over time, noisy, and to change such that you cannot rely on a single measurement or value.
